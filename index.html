<h3> Sprint Completed Stories</h3>
<ul>
<li>Project Status Report</li>
<li>Upload app on hosting platform</li>

</ul>
<p>We worked on the project status report as part of the documentation of this project. We created the user stories, milestones and project dashboard in github. We also conducted a product backlog grooming session. We went through the starter code to understand it. We uploaded the starter code on the heroku app. We faced challenges in uploading the code to the heroku app, because of some code changes that we initially made. The key lesson from the challenges was that the we decided to work on a branch so that the mainline is not affected.   </p>

<h3>Product Backlog</h3>

<p>While we have not determined the final contents of the sprint 2, we are going to be focused on the stories which will add more value to the end user. We have therefore currently prioritized vewing the events details and creation of new events for the next sprint.In addition, we will also be working on the view page.</p> 
<ul>
<li>Create new events</li>
<li>View event details</li>
<li>View about page</li>
<li>View home page</li>
<li>RSVP for an event</li>
<li>Support an event</li>
