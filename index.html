<h3> Sprint Completed Stories</h3>

<li>View about page</li>
<li>Project Status Report</li>
</ul>
<p>We worked on the project status report as part of the documentation of this project. We created the user stories, milestones and project dashboard in github. We also conducted a product backlog grooming session. We went through the starter code to understand it. With respect to the coding, we worked on the code for viewing the 'about page'.</p>

<p>While we have not determined the final contents of the sprint 2, we are going to be focused on the stories which will add more value to the end user. We have therefore currently prioritized vewing the events details and creation of new events for the next sprint.</p>

<li>Create new events</li>
<li>View event details</li>
<li>View home page</li>
