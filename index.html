<h3> Sprint Completed Stories</h3>
<ul>
<li>View about page - Enhancement</li>
<li>Create event - Enhancement</li>
<li>RSVP related database update - DB Schema Update</li>
<li>RSVP for the event - Enhancement</li>
<li>View event details - Enhancement</li>
<li>Images in events - Bug</li>
</ul>
<p>We worked on the functionalities that add most value to the user including creating events, viewing event details, RSVP for the events and about page. We also worked on bug fixing. We faced challenges related to parsing of time on the create events page which we will fix in the next sprint. In this sprint, we worked on separate branches and merged the pull requests. This enabled the devlopers to work on the code simultaneously.  </p>

<h3>Product Backlog</h3>
